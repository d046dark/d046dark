### 👋 Greetings, I'm Alan.

I'm currently working for semiconductor industry as an Equipment Software Engineer🛠️. A senior PC-based software engineer who used to work with C# & LabVIEW to implement production or R&D systems. Currently, I am looking for relative materials about C# & DevOps ♾️. Suppose this operation tool can relieve some efforts and provide concrete automated test in CI/CD.
